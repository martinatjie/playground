It should also help with prioritizing - e.g. comparing things with one another or allowing you to compare and then choose which one is better to tackle first.
- Home organizer and improvement app
- I almost never put my stuff into the appropriate folders when I save them. Why? It's tedious to go through the whole nav menu to find the folder I want to save it in. Solution: A file explorer that makes good suggestions where to save a file.
- Infographic maker
- instrument
- investment success calculator
- irrigation system with multiple channels
- It is difficult to find files once saved. It's also difficult to find attachments in gmail if you cannot find the saved file and have to go back to the source to find it.Solution: An event list, like an audit list showing when I did/saved what and with what file name. A gmail attachment finder. OR a better mail client. OR a browser extension for gmail.

- Problem: Windows search is extremely slow and after search results it is still extremely cumbersome to check which file is the right one. Solution: Scenarios that I want to use instead of a global search... I want to tell AI what I am looking for in natural language. It should then figure out what kinds of search criteria to apply. Very much like OpenAI/ChatGPT/Bingbot/Bard - it should be super quick and very accurate and helpful. It should be able to also answer questions for me without me having to open a file and finding the answer myself.</blue>

- Solve this problem: Organizing photos is an even more tedious task and this is so sad, because I actually want to cherish the memories and look through photos and have joy doing so. I want to create albums and print them based on what was organized, but opening up every photo to see what it is and then going back and moving it to the right folder is irritating. You lose track of where you were. Thumbnails often aren't big enough to determine 1) what the photo is or 2) whether it's of a good enough quality. And then you have the problem with duplicates, or not necessarily duplicates but photos shot 4x in a row of the same thing at slightly different angles and now wanting to determine which one is the best. But at the same time, you want to keep a selection going because you e.g. want to send photos to someone via email. You can only ever inspect or select, but not both.

- whiteboard similar to Miro
- write a common algorithm in various different programming languages
- write a Lulu.com book about coding using its API
- write an own backend programming language that makes a few things that annoy me with C# easier - e.g. lots of words for things are not intuitive enough especially for foreign language speakers and people who don't have any other programming or computer science background. It should also make error handling and logging super easy and have cool null handling options.
