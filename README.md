Here's a living list of things to make for practice and beyond.
Make them as easy and basic or as difficult and complex as you like!

- "Find the bugs" game for new devs
- Accounting program

- better prioritization app
- Bouquet booklet maker app for weddings
- C4 diagram drawing app based on your code or AI prompts.
- choose your own adventure book (or an app that makes it easy for you to write your own choose your own adventure - I think l linked lists might be cool to use here?)
- clever shopping list that uses buying patterns to make new lists whenever the time comes to buy the same thing again
- CMS to create coding blogs specifically
- Code some electronic decorations for celebratory cakes e.g. lights, special effects, sound etc.
- Coding/Work stats tracker and analyser

- dev video editor with censorer / blur when there are sensitive items on screen
- Diamond Dot Painting maker
- Discovery simplifier and reward finder ;-) this goes for any convoluted policies!
- DnD character generator
- DnD for dummies app
- document and file auto namer that also appends the date, would be cool to have image recognition too and content recognition to make name suggestions or auto-name
- Documentation writing app / (for Playbook/Runbook)
- doorbell that allows you to play a favourite song as a chime or something from a spotify playlist
- Dungeons and Dragons app for a dungeon master
- dynamic visual studio project/solution template that gets you going fast
- Email unsubscriber
- escape room game
- feed long PDF into AI and ask it questions based on content
- Filing & expenses app
- Library for fluent log assertions, especially that work on "contains"
- Game remakes: - e.g. Bingo, various boardgames like Cluedo, Monopoly, Scrabble etc. (make them print 'n play)
- Game Timer
- garden design/planner app that can help you map out your perfect garden and suggests improvements based on industry knowledge & ML
- Gift registry app (and browser extension) that allows you to add items from anywhere with links to the purchase location
- Gmail email sorter
- greeting card app
- helper app for people with ADHD or people who are not good at time and capacity management / executive functioning which tells them when they've taken on too much and suggests how to divide and conquer. It should also help with prioritizing - e.g. comparing things with one another or allowing you to compare and then choose which one is better to tackle first.
- Home organizer and improvement app
- I almost never put my stuff into the appropriate folders when I save them. Why? It's tedious to go through the whole nav menu to find the folder I want to save it in. Solution: A file explorer that makes good suggestions where to save a file.
- Infographic maker
- instrument
- investment success calculator
- irrigation system with multiple channels
- It is difficult to find files once saved. It's also difficult to find attachments in gmail if you cannot find the saved file and have to go back to the source to find it.Solution: An event list, like an audit list showing when I did/saved what and with what file name. A gmail attachment finder. OR a better mail client. OR a browser extension for gmail.
- Journal making app where users can add their own topics that they wish to track
- List comparer app that checks for duplicates based on natural language

- More advanced "pomodoro timer" that tells you when to stretch and asks you as soon as you start moving your move or keyboard again if you want to start the timer again.
- Mouse pointer stats gatherer - like an app that checks the longest interval at which the mouse pointer is not moving while still working (e.g to track thinking time)
- MS Teams bot
- murder mystery dinner game helper app
- Music genre classifier
- Music mood identifier & suggestions
- music "mutator" that removes swear words from songs and replaces them with something else
- mystery box prompt generator app with a prompt submitter which is very generic so it allows you to create any categories of prompts and clusters of prompts. It should look like a real mystery box, in other words have a really cool user interface.
- Neighbourhood patrol app
- OCR conversion
- packing app that works according to the weather forecast for the period you are on vacation and activities you will do, with AI prompts.
- paint by algorithm
- Party planning app with checklists categorized as "do upfront", "do on the day" etc.
- Password vault
- Payment gateway

- Play with Backstage
- Playlist creator based on prompts
- Portfolio maker
- priority sorting helper
- Pressure sensor for your office chair that tells you when it's time to take a break
- Problem: Windows search is extremely slow and after search results it is still extremely cumbersome to check which file is the right one. Solution: Scenarios that I want to use instead of a global search... I want to tell AI what I am looking for in natural language. It should then figure out what kinds of search criteria to apply. Very much like OpenAI/ChatGPT/Bingbot/Bard - it should be super quick and very accurate and helpful. It should be able to also answer questions for me without me having to open a file and finding the answer myself.</blue>
- publish-to-all-social

- Sign language app where people in deaf community can upload signs (co-creation) - try validate using AI
- slack bot
- Small group bible study app
- Solve this problem: Organizing photos is an even more tedious task and this is so sad, because I actually want to cherish the memories and look through photos and have joy doing so. I want to create albums and print them based on what was organized, but opening up every photo to see what it is and then going back and moving it to the right folder is irritating. You lose track of where you were. Thumbnails often aren't big enough to determine 1) what the photo is or 2) whether it's of a good enough quality. And then you have the problem with duplicates, or not necessarily duplicates but photos shot 4x in a row of the same thing at slightly different angles and now wanting to determine which one is the best. But at the same time, you want to keep a selection going because you e.g. want to send photos to someone via email. You can only ever inspect or select, but not both.

- Table setting/decoration helper app

- test assertion converter e.g. from fluent to nsubstitute
- Text summariser / File summariser
- Themed menu maker app
- timer finder app using AI: e.g. person X does not like 1PM meetings, person Y has no-meeting Mondays etc. It then finds the best spot for a meetup based on everyone's preferences.
- Topic generator app - e.g. a for party topics, art topics etc.
- "Track my subscriptions and trial expiry dates" app to prevent overcharging and good use of apps
- visual studio extension to assist with proper exception handling norms

- web scraper
- Wheel of Fortune
- when clicking a link, if the tab is already open, focus on the tab and do not reopen the link
- "what are the odds" chance calculator
- whiteboard similar to Miro
- write a common algorithm in various different programming languages
- write a Lulu.com book about coding using its API
- write an own backend programming language that makes a few things that annoy me with C# easier - e.g. lots of words for things are not intuitive enough especially for foreign language speakers and people who don't have any other programming or computer science background. It should also make error handling and logging super easy and have cool null handling options.
- Write your own logging, authentication/authorization, monitoring or error handling middleware
- Yaml Helper for K8s newbies
